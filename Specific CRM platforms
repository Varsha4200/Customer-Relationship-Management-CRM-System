To customize your CRMImplementation class based on specific CRM platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho, or Dynamics, we can add platform-specific configurations. For example, each platform may have its own unique features, API integrations, and reporting capabilities.
Here's how we can expand your class to reflect customization based on CRM platforms:

Add platform-specific configurations: Customize the CRM setup to fit each platform's functionality (like workflows, reporting, and data management).

Include API keys: If you plan to integrate with these CRMs programmatically, you can store API keys or authentication details.

Adjust processes for each CRM: Different CRMs have varying workflows, so we can fine-tune those processes.

What's New:
Platform-Specific Configurations: The _get_platform_config method customizes the CRM features based on the selected platform. This includes automation, reporting tools, and integrations.

Flexible Platform Selection: You can pass any CRM platform like "HubSpot," "Salesforce," "Zoho," or "Dynamics" when creating the class instance, and it will automatically adjust to the corresponding settings.

Display Platform Config: The display_platform_config method shows platform-specific details like the enabled features and integrations.

Example_
Platform: Salesforce
Workflow_automation: True
Lead_scoring: True
Reporting_tools: ['Custom Reports', 'Salesforce Einstein Analytics']
Integration: ['Email', 'Sales Cloud', 'Marketing Cloud']

This way, you can easily extend and adapt this class for more CRM platforms as needed and adjust the workflow or settings based on the platform you're using.
