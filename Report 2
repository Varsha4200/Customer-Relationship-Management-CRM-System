Progress Report
Project Name: The CRM System Development

A. Milestone and Subtasks
Milestone: Planning and Requirements Gathering (March 1–March 20, 2025)

Subtasks:

Determine the needs of the business (March 1–March 5).

Choose a CRM provider between March 5 and March 10.

Establish the project's parameters (March 10–March 15).

Make a schedule for the project (March 15–20).

By guaranteeing clarity on the business needs, project scope, and vendor selection, these responsibilities lay the groundwork for the CRM system's successful deployment.

B. Success Evaluation
Were we successful? Not yet

Why or why not?
We are currently getting ready to start the first task, "Identify business requirements," on March 1st; however, the project is still in its early phases. The thoroughness of the requirements gathering procedure, the suitability of the vendor selection, and the clarity of the project scope will all be critical to the achievement of this milestone. Even if this milestone's duties haven't been completed yet, the project is on track to succeed because every step has been carefully planned. The key to maintaining smooth development is choosing the correct vendor, defining specific project goals, and creating a reasonable schedule.

C. Lessons Learned
Clear grasp of requirements: In order to prevent future misalignment, it is essential to have a thorough grasp of company needs prior to choosing a CRM vendor.

Extensive vendor evaluation: The company's long-term objectives and business requirements should inform the data-driven vendor selection process.

Detailed Project Scope: Setting reasonable expectations and preventing scope creep are two benefits of early scope definition.

E. Action Items for Team Members
Finalizing Business Requirements: To make sure the CRM system precisely satisfies the demands of the company, the initial step, "Identify business requirements," should be comprehensive and involve all important stakeholders.

Vendor Selection: In order to make a decision before March 30, begin evaluating vendors as soon as possible. This guarantees that the remainder of the development process can move on without interruption.

Communication: To guarantee agreement on goals, parameters, and expectations, keep lines of communication open with all parties involved.

Testing Strategy: To guarantee effective and organized testing and feedback gathering, create a testing strategy beforehand.

User Training Preparation: Begin developing training materials to ensure a smooth transition when the CRM system is deployed.

       Overall, the CRM System Development phase ensures the project stays on track and meets all                necessary milestones.
