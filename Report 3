Milestone and Subtasks

Milestone: Planning and Requirements Gathering (March 1 – March 20, 2025)
This foundational phase focuses on establishing clear and actionable objectives for the CRM implementation.

Subtasks Completed/Planned:

Determine business needs (March 1–5)

Select a CRM vendor (March 5–10)

Define project parameters (March 10–15)

Develop a project schedule (March 15–20)

These tasks aim to ensure a well-scoped, vendor-aligned solution with strategic objectives in mind, creating a reliable base for development and deployment.

Success Evaluation

Status: In Progress

Although the planning phase is not yet completed, the project remains on schedule. We are preparing to begin the “Identify business requirements” task, and all preparatory actions are aligned with the timeline.

Reasoning:
Success at this stage hinges on collecting comprehensive and accurate business needs, selecting a vendor that aligns with both functional and technical expectations, and clearly defining the project’s scope. While no subtasks have been completed yet, the project is proceeding with a well-structured plan, indicating a strong likelihood of success.

Lessons Learned (Past 2 Weeks)

Requirement Clarity is Critical: We’ve confirmed that unclear or incomplete business needs can derail vendor selection and lead to costly misalignment during development.

Vendor Selection Should Be Data-Driven: Vendor evaluation must incorporate both current and long-term strategic needs, technical compatibility, and scalability.

Early Scope Definition Prevents Issues: A detailed and realistic scope at this stage helps manage expectations and mitigate scope creep during development.

In summary, the CRM System Development project is moving forward as planned.  We are in a strong position to meet our next development milestone on time because to early stakeholder involvement, focused execution, and proactive planning.  Our methodical approach guarantees the CRM system's long-term scalability and use while reflecting best practices in IT project management.
